    <h1>Welcome to your first Exercise!</h1>
    <p>for this exercise we will be creating a weight metric converter</p>
    <p>we will take in a nubmer in pounds(lbs) and converter it to kilograms(kg). Right now we only know enough to this one way, but later on we will learn how to add logic to this sort of problem!</p>
    <p>To complete this exercise do the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Link this HTML file (Part3_Exercise.html) to you own .js file</li>
      <li>Use javascript to accept a number input in pounds(lbs)</li>
      <li>Then in your js file convert this number to kilograms(*0.454)</li>
      <li>After log/write "Conversion Completed" to the colsole</li>
    </ul>
